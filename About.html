        <h2>A Little Bit About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a Utah native and I love the great outdoors (I know, super original). I've spent the last
            8 years in the mortgage space and have reached a point where it's no longer fulfilling or
            challenging. I stumbled upon coding and am excited about pursuing it as a career.</p>
        <p>When I'm not working, I like to spend my time cooking, traveling, gardening, hiking, on and 
            in the water, and going to the theater for everything from concerts to ballet. 
            I adore animals and have a dog, Gizmo, and a cat, Jelly Bean - 
            they have a very comfortable life!</p>
